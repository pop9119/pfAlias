# pfAlias
Alias files used in firewall.

This is a list of Alias used in a firewall system. They are used for creating rules for either blocking or passing traffic. These lists were created via personal research using public information.

Bypass4 and Bypass6 are IP's that AS# downloads seem to miss. They are for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively. They are a manual list created by me.
